# Scriptorium
Let's power the scriptorium. It's a room with a Mac Studio 128gb, a phone, some apple studio headphones, that's it. Estimate the monthly energy usage.

Actually tho, the Mac Studio is running computations for a decentralized grid network so it's running 24/7 at full blast.

Let's power the scriptorium. It's a room with a Mac Studio 128gb, a phone, some apple studio headphones, that's it. Estimate the monthly energy usage. I think it'd be somewhere around 60kwh/mo?

To estimate the monthly energy usage of the devices in the scriptorium, let's break down the usage for each device individually.

Mac Studio 128GB: Apple lists the maximum continuous power consumption of the Mac Studio as 370W. Assuming 8 hours of use per day:
370W * 8h/day * 30 days = 88,800Wh or 88.8kWh per month
Please note that this is a maximum estimation under the assumption of the computer running at full power for the entire 8 hours. Regular usage would likely result in a lower power consumption.

Phone: Let's assume the phone has a battery capacity of around 3000mAh and a charging voltage of 5V. Assuming 1 full charge per day:
(3000mAh * 5V) * 30 days = 450,000mWh or 0.45kWh per month
Apple Studio Headphones: The Apple Studio Headphones have a battery capacity of around 600mAh and a charging voltage of 5V. Assuming 1 full charge per day:
(600mAh * 5V) * 30 days = 90,000mWh or 0.09kWh per month
Summing up the energy usage for each device:

88.8kWh (Mac Studio) + 0.45kWh (Phone) + 0.09kWh (Headphones) = 89.34kWh per month
The estimated total monthly energy usage for the scriptorium is approximately 89.34kWh. This is a rough estimation, and real-world usage may vary depending on actual usage patterns, power management settings, and other factors.

assume 24/7 max full blast on the mac studio

If the Mac Studio operates at its maximum continuous power consumption of 370W for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the energy usage calculation changes:

370W * 24h/day * 30 days = 266,400Wh or 266.4kWh per month
Adding the energy usage for the phone and the headphones:

266.4kWh (Mac Studio) + 0.45kWh (Phone) + 0.09kWh (Headphones) = 266.94kWh per month
Under the assumption of the Mac Studio running at full power 24/7, the estimated total monthly energy usage for the scriptorium would be approximately 266.94kWh. However, this is an extreme scenario and may not reflect typical usage patterns.
